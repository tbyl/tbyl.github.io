I'm an undergraduate student from the Leeds Joint School, Southwest Jiaotong University. My research interests include multimodal learning, natural language processing, and large language models, with a focus on enhancing the robustness of language models against word-level disruptions.

I am currently advised by [Prof. Fengmao Lv](https://fengmaolv.github.io/online-cv/) at Tiggers Lab and have had the pleasure of working on several cutting-edge projects involving LLM Robustness and multimodal tasks.

You can find my CV here: [Li Yang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/LiYang-CV.pdf).
