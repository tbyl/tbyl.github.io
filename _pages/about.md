I'm a graduate student from the School of Computer Science, Southwest Jiaotong University. My research interests include multimodal learning, natural language processing, and large language models, with a focus on enhancing the robustness of language models against word-level disruptions.

I am currently advised by Prof. Fengmao Lv at Tiggers Lab and have had the pleasure of working on several cutting-edge projects involving model generalization and multimodal tasks. 

You can find my CV here: Li Yang's Curriculum Vitae.
